# The Coding Challenge

1. Fork this repo into your own Github repository.
2. Develop a very simple RESTful API that listens on a publicly accessible HTTP endpoint for GET calls at `api/resources` and returns the `resources` from `data/ebbcarbon.yaml`. Use whatever language and framework you like - be prepared to tell us why you chose what you did.
3. Containerize this application, unless you have a good justification for why not.
4. Use the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool of your choice to deploy this API onto AWS. If you don't have an AWS account you can use free tier AWS resources for this test. Be prepared to tell us why you chose what you did.
5. Create a PR and tag us on that when you're done.
